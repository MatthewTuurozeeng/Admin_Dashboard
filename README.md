# Admin_Dashboard
The Admin Dashboard project is a frontend layout exercise. In the project, you will build a structured dashboard interface similar to those used by website administrators. It focuses on creating a clean layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox, organizing content through proper HTML nesting, and integrating visual assets like icons and images. 

This is a simple Dashboard User Interface built with HTML, CSS (Grid and Flexbox). It mimics a modern web app interface, featuring sidebar navigation, a project overview panel, announcements, trending items, and basic interactivity.
